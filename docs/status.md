# Current status

At present, this project is my personal playground. Like any open-source initiative,
the code is open for perusal – and that's the primary expectation to set.

## What works?

So far, I've managed to run and build my [Telplin project](https://github.com/nojaf/telplin/) locally.
It's a promising start, though it's not yet primed for broader use.
This project does support Fable plugins, but compatibility with other projects isn't assured.

## What is published?

A first package was pushed to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-fable). This was merely to reserve the package name.

## Own aspirations

I'm looking to incorporate this into a few of my ventures, like [Fantomas tools](https://fsprojects.github.io/fantomas-tools/),
and I'm intrigued by the potential integration with Astro projects and the inclusion of simple scripts.

## The roadmap

This project is a sporadic labor of love. Progress is steady but unhurried, with significant intervals between updates.
I am committed to seeing this through, convinced of its substantial value.
Yet, there's an air of 'memento mori' – it's a passion project that could fade at any moment.

## Everything else

Heads up, folks! The GitHub issue tracker is off the grid. Why, you ask? This isn't just another code repository.
It's a journey, a chunk of my life carved into digital form. Sure, the code's there for you, open and free.
But my time? That's a different story. I've poured years into these skills, building, breaking, learning.
So, I'm channeling my energy into the code, not endless chats.

Got something sharp, a genuine gem of a contribution? I'm all about that.
Throw a PR my way. Let's get the conversation rolling with some real, in-depth code talk.
Show me you've got the game, that you're not just passing through.

And if you're thinking, "Hey, I need this guy on my side," then we're talking business, my friend.  
[Hit me up](https://nojaf.com/) for some contracting work. That's the signal to me that you're serious, ready to invest in making something awesome together.
