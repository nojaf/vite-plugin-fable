## What is this?

Alright, the `tl;dr` is that I don't like the current way of how you can use [Fable](https://fable.io) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). 
I'm referring to the steps in the [get started with Vite](https://fable.io/docs/getting-started/javascript.html#browser), I don't like it and have an alternate take on it.

More thoughts on this can be read from the [documentation](https://fable.io/vite-plugin-fable/).

## Current status

A first package was pushed to npm. This was merely to reserve the package name.  
You can read the code, that's is it for now.

## Video

I talked a little bit about this project during this stream:
